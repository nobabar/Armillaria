Carried out during an internship at the INRAE research site of the Pierroton forest. This intership was help in the course of the third year of a biology degree.

The genus Armillaria, belonging to the phylum Basidiomycetes and the family Physalacriaceae, is a complex of species with saprotrophic or parasitic behavior. It is therefore studied for its impacts on forest health. The species of this complex are very close and their identification is a delicate task where morphological and biological criteria sometimes have difficulty. Phylogenetic criteria are therefore the most common, however, requiring data in both quantity and quality. We develop here an identification method based on diagnostic SNPs for European species. The SNPs detected and the identifications are consistent with identifications by phylogenetic criteria while being simpler and more convenient to use. This method shows 75 % efficiency in the first tests, the proximity and the polymorphism making the determination and the detection of SNPs complex. This shows, once again, the continuity of this species complex and the difficulty of its classification.
